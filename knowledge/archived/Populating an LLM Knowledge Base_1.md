Think of your corpus as the knowledge you actually reach for when solving real problems. Developers who get the most from a personal RAG stack usually prioritize three tiers:

### 1. High-value, frequently referenced material
- **Personal notes & meeting docs** – your Obsidian vault, design decisions, requirements, architecture diagrams, retros. These are unique to you and give the assistant context no public model can provide.
- **Project codebases & READMEs** – both current projects and past ones. Include onboarding docs, build scripts, configs, troubleshooting notes.

### 2. External sources that feed your day-to-day work
- **Official documentation and APIs** – e.g. OpenAI API docs, frameworks (React, FastAPI, LangChain), database manuals. Many devs mirror the docs they use so answers stay grounded even offline.
- **Tutorials & blog posts** you keep revisiting; also relevant Stack Overflow or GitHub Discussions threads.
- **Reference books/papers** (PDFs or EPUBs converted to text/Markdown) if you lean on them for architecture or algorithms.

### 3. Personal context & logs
- **Chat transcripts** (ChatGPT, Slack, Teams) with solutions, command snippets, or discussions you’ll revisit later.
- **Experiment logs and notebook exports** – captures how you tuned models, ran benchmarks, fixed bugs.
- **Operational checklists / runbooks** – anything that helps you repeat procedures reliably.

Trends from the last six months among practitioners:

- **Engineering knowledge gardens**: combining product specs, Jira tickets, release notes, and RFCs so the assistant remembers “why” decisions were made.
- **AI + ops runbooks**: step-by-step incident responses, deployment pipelines, and cloud infrastructure configs.
- **DevRel & learning hubs**: curated newsletters, podcasts, conference talks summarized into digestible chunks.
- **Research digests**: groups subscribing to arXiv/Hugging Face model cards, converting them to Markdown for rapid search.

Less hype but very valuable:

- **Personal CRM / networking notes** to prep for meetings.
- **Financial/administrative documents** (receipts, invoices, tax prep) once you add strong access controls.
- **Tokenized media transcripts** (YouTube courses, conference videos) when transcripts are rich.

A simple rule: ingest anything you’re likely to search for again. Start with the sources that unblock your daily work, then expand. As the corpus grows, invest in tagging (front matter) and scheduled ingestion so it stays organized and fresh.

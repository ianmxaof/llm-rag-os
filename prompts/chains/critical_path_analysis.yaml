steps:
  - description: "Extract assumptions"
    prompt: |
      Given this context:
      {context}
      
      List every assumption present in the text.
      Format as numbered list.
    temperature: 0.3
    rag_k: 10
  
  - description: "Score assumptions by risk"
    prompt: |
      Given these assumptions:
      {context}
      
      Score each assumption on two dimensions:
      1. Risk if wrong (catastrophic/high/medium/low)
      2. Impact on outcome (1-10)
      
      Format as table.
    temperature: 0.2
    rag_k: 8
  
  - description: "Identify highest leverage action"
    prompt: |
      Given this risk analysis:
      {context}
      
      Identify the single assumption with highest leverage (risk × impact).
      Output ONLY the highest-leverage action item in one sentence.
